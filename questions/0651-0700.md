Explanation: The cost of an IAM user or group can never be tracked separately for the purpose of billing. The best solution in this case is to create a separate account for each department and use consolidated billing. (shw: C)

- [ ] Setup IAM groups for each department and track their usage
- [ ] Setup IAM users for each department and track their usage
- [ ] Create separate accounts for each department, but use consolidated billing for payment and tracking
- [x] Create separate accounts for each department and track them separately



### Question 657: A user is part of a group that has a policy allowing him just read-only access to EC2. The user is part of another group that has full access to EC2. What happens when the user tries to launch an instance? Explanation: The IAM group policy is always aggregated. In this case, if the user does not have permission for one group, but has permission for another group, he will have full access to EC2. Unless there is a specific deny policy, the user will be able to access EC2. (shw: B)

- [ ] It will fail since the user has just read-only access
- [ ] It will allow the user to launch the instance
- [ ] It will allow or deny based on the group under which the user has logged into EC2
- [x] It will not allow the user to add to the conflicting groups



### Question 658: An ELB is diverting traffic across 5 instances. One of the instances was unhealthy only for 20 minutes. What will happen after 20 minutes when the instance becomes healthy? Explanation: AWS Elastic Load Balancing continuously checks the health of an instance. If one of the instances is unhealthy it stops sending traffic to it and automatically reroutes the traffic to the remaining running EC2 instances. If the failed EC2 instance is restored, Elastic Load Balancing will again start sending traffic to that instance.

- [ ] ELB will never divert traffic back to the same instance
- [ ] ELB will not automatically send traffic to the same instance. However, the user can configure to start sending traffic to the same instance
- [x] ELB starts sending traffic to the instance once it is healthy
- [ ] ELB terminates the instance once it is unhealthy. Thus, the instance cannot be healthy after 10 minutes



### Question 659: You are using Amazon SQS and are getting a "Queue Deleted Recently" error. What is wrong? Explanation: Please note that when you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send to a recently deleted queue might succeed during the 60-second period. For example, a SendMessage request might succeed, but after 60 seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist. (shw: A)

- [ ] If you delete a queue, you need to wait for at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name
- [ ] You have incorrect permissions
- [x] Another user has deleted the queue
- [ ] The message is too big

### Question 668: A user has created an EBS volume from an existing snapshot. The data is being loaded lazily from S3 to the volume. If the user tries to access the data of the volume which is not yet loaded, what will happen? Explanation: When the user creates a new Amazon EBS volume, he may create it based on an existing snapshot. The new volume will be created as an exact replica of the original volume that was used to create the snapshot. New volumes created from existing Amazon S3 snapshots load lazily in the background. Thus, the user can start using them immediately. If the instance accesses a piece of data that has not yet been loaded, the volume immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3 and then continues loading the rest of the volume's data in the background. (shw: A)

- [ ] The volume downloads the data from S3 so that the user can access it
- [ ] The user cannot access the data until all the data is loaded
- [ ] The volume throws an error when the data required is not found and asks the user to try after sometime
- [x] The data is not loaded lazily. Volume is available only when the whole data is loaded



### Question 669: A user has configured an automated backup between 5 AM - 5:30 AM for the MySQL RDS DB. Will the performance of RDS get frozen momentarily during a backup? Explanation: Amazon RDS provides two different methods for backing up and restoring the Amazon DB instances. A brief I/O freeze, typically lasting a few seconds, occurs during both automated backups and DB snapshot operations on Single-AZ DB instances.

- [ ] No
- [ ] Yes, always
- [ ] Yes, only if the instance size is smaller than the large size
- [x] Yes, provided it is a single zone implementation



### Question 670: A user is configuring an application with the PostgreSQL RDS instance. The user does not want a mandatory maintenance window. How can the user configure this? Explanation: The Amazon RDS system performs maintenance on the DB instance during user-definable maintenance. It is not possible to skip its configuration. If the user does not configure it, RDS will take the default time based on the RDS region. (shw: B)

- [ ] The user should select the option as 'No' in the Management Options screen against the Maintenance window
- [ ] It is not possible to skip the mandatory maintenance window
- [ ] The user should skip the step to configure the maintenance window

If the user deletes the snapshot of Day-2, what will happen? Explanation: Snapshot is an incremental concept and EBS takes a snapshot of only the modified blocks of volume. In this case, Day-2 will have blocks of modified "B" and new "D". Since "D" is not modified on Day-3 it will not be deleted. However, as "B" was modified on Day-3 it is not being referred to by any snapshot and EBS will delete that block.

- [ ] It will remove the snapshot of Day-2 and the user will lose the contents of Blocks-"B" and "D"
- [ ] delete the block which was referred to as modified "B" as well newly created "D" of Day 2
- [ ] Nothing. The user cannot delete the snapshot as it is being referred to in other blocks
- [x] It will delete the block which was referred to as modified "B" of Day 2



### Question 683: A user has enabled versioning of a bucket. Is it possible to store all the versions of the objects in RRS and the current version of the object in S3?

Explanation: The user can use commands, such as: - create-key-pair (AWS CLI); - ec2-create-keypair (Amazon EC2 CLI), or New-EC2KeyPair (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) to create a new key-pair. The user can use ec2-import-keypair to import their own key-pair.

- [ ] ec2-create-keypair
- [x] ec2-upload-keypair
- [ ] ec2-import-keypair
- [ ] New-EC2KeyPair



### Question 694: An online exam starts at 9 AM. All the participants will do an I/O on a standard EBS-backed instance at 9 AM. How can the user initially achieve a higher I/O performance when the EBS is not pre-warmed? Explanation: There is a 5 to 50 percent reduction in IOPS when the user first accesses each block of data on a newly created or restored EBS volume. The user can avoid this performance hit by accessing each block in advance or pre-warm the Amazon EBS volumes. (shw: B)

- [ ] The EBS will automatically scale up the I/O when the load increases
- [ ] The user should access all the blocks of data before the exam in advance
- [ ] Use the ELB to distribute the load on EBS
- [x] The user should select the instance with a higher size to avoid an initial low I/O



### Question 695: You have written a CloudFormation template that creates 1 Elastic Load Balancer fronting 2 EC2 Instances. Which section of the template should you edit so that the DNS of the load balancer is returned upon creation of the stack? Explanation: You can use AWS CloudFormation's sample templates or create your own templates to describe the AWS resources, and any associated dependencies or runtime parameters, required to run your application.

- [ ] Parameters
- [x] Outputs
- [ ] Resources
- [ ] Mappings



### Question 696: A user has created a new EBS volume from an existing snapshot. The user mounts the volume on the instance to which it is attached. Which of the below-mentioned options is a required step before the user can mount the volume? Explanation: When a user is trying to mount a blank EBS volume, it is required that the user first creates a file system within the volume. If the volume is created from an existing snapshot then the user needs to not create a file system on the volume as it will wipe out the existing data. (shw: A)

- [ ] No step is required. The user can directly mount the device
- [ ] Run a cyclic check on the device for data consistency
- [ ] Resize the volume as per the original snapshot size
- [x] Create the file system of the volume



### Question 697: A user has set the IAM policy where it denies all requests if a request is not from IP 10.10.10.1/32. The other policy says to allow all requests between 5 PM to 7 PM. What will happen when a user is requesting access from IP 10.10.10.1/32 at 6 PM? Explanation: When a request is made, the AWS IAM policy decides whether a given request should be allowed or denied. The evaluation logic follows these rules: - By default, all requests are denied. (In general, requests made using the account credentials for resources in the account are always allowed.); - An explicit allow policy overrides this default; - An explicit deny policy overrides any allows. In this case, there are explicit deny and explicit allow statements. Thus, the request will be denied since deny overrides are allowed.

- [ ] It will allow access
- [ ] IAM will throw an error for policy conflict
- [ ] It is not possible to set a policy based on the time or IP
- [x] It will deny access



### Question 698: An IAM user is trying to perform an action on an object belonging to some other root account's bucket. Which of the below-mentioned options will AWS S3 not verify? Explanation: If the IAM user is trying to perform some action on the object belonging to another AWS user's bucket, S3 will verify whether the owner of the IAM user has given sufficient permission to him. It also verifies the policy for the bucket as well as the policy defined by the object owner.

- [ ] The object owner has provided access to the IAM user
- [x] Permission provided by the parent of the IAM user on the bucket
- [ ] Permission provided by the bucket owner to the IAM user
- [ ] Permission provided by the parent of the IAM user



### Question 699: You want to have multiple versions of your application running at the same time, with all versions launched via AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Is this possible? Explanation: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is designed to support multiple running environments. As an example, you could have one for integration testing, one for pre-production, and one for production, with each environment independently configured and running on its own separate AWS resources.

- [ ] Yes. However, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is designed to support only 2 multiple-running environments
- [ ] No. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is not designed to support multiple running environments
- [ ] No. However, if you have 2 AWS accounts this can be done
- [x] Yes. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is designed to support a number of multiple running environments



### Question 700: In regard to DynamoDB actions, which one of the following statements explains the meaning of "HTTP Status Code: 404"? Explanation: In DynamoDB, there are several actions that have HTTP status codes that help developers understand errors and the status of each action. for example: the "MalformedQueryString", which means the query string contains a syntax error, will return the HTTP status code 404. (shw: B)

- [ ] The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure.
- [ ] The query string contains a syntax error.
- [ ] The request was denied due to request throttling.
- [x] The AWS access key ID needs a subscription for the service.
