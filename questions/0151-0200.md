- [x] Publish each generated value as a custom metric to Amazon CloudWatch using available AWS SDKs.
- [ ] Store each value as a variable and add the variable to the list of EC2 metrics that should be reported to the Amazon CloudWatch console.



### Question 196: A Development team decides to adopt a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) process using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeCommit for a new application. However, management wants a person to review and approve the code before it is deployed to production. How can the Development team add a manual approver to the CI/CD pipeline?

- [ ] Use AWS SES to send an email to approvers when their action is required. Develop a simple application that allows approvers to accept or reject a build. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to advance the pipeline when a build is accepted.
- [ ] If approved, add an approved tag when pushing changes to the CodeCommit repository. CodePipeline will proceed to build and deploy approved commits without interruption.
- [ ] Add an approval step to CodeCommit. Commits will not be saved until approved.
- [x] Add an approval action to the pipeline. Configure the approval action to publish to an Amazon SNS topic when approval is required. The pipeline execution will stop and wait for approval.



### Question 197: A Developer is building a serverless application using AWS Lambda and must create a REST API using an HTTP GET method. What needs to be defined to meet this requirement? (Select TWO.)

- [ ] A Lambda@Edge function.
- [x] An Amazon API Gateway with a Lambda function.
- [x] An exposed GET method in an Amazon API Gateway.
- [ ] An exposed GET method in the Lambda function.
- [ ] An exposed GET method in Amazon Route 53.



### Question 198: A Developer is writing an application in AWS Lambda. To simplify testing and deployments, the Developer needs the database connection string to be easily changed without modifying the Lambda code. How can this requirement be met? (shw: C)

- [x] Store the connection string as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
- [ ] Store the connection string in an IAM user account.
- [ ] Store the connection string in AWS KMS.
- [ ] Store the connection string as a Lambda layer.



### Question 199: A company is launching an e-commerce website and will host the static data in Amazon S3. The company expects approximately 1,000 transactions per second (TPS) for GET and PUT requests in total. Logging must be enabled to track all requests and must be retained for auditing purposes. What is the MOST cost-effective solution? (shw: C)

- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail logging for the S3 bucket-level action and create a lifecycle policy to move the data from the log bucket to Amazon S3 Glacier in 90 days.
- [x] Enable S3 server access logging and create a lifecycle policy to expire the data in 90 days.
- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail logging for the S3 bucket-level action and create a lifecycle policy to expire the data in 90 days.
- [ ] Enable S3 server access logging and create a lifecycle policy to move the data to Amazon S3 Glacier in 90 days.



### Question 200: A Developer decides to store highly secure data in Amazon S3 and wants to implement server-side encryption (SSE) with granular control of who can access the master key. Company policy requires that the master key be created, rotated, and disabled easily when needed, all for security reasons. Which solution should be used to meet these requirements? (shw: C)

- [ ] SSE with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
- [x] SSE with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS).
- [ ] SSE with AWS Secrets Manager.
- [ ] SSE with customer-provided encryption keys.
