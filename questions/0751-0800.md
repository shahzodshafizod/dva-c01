- [ ] 100
- [x] Unlimited
- [ ] 256



### Question 754: A root owner wants to set up MFA with a smartphone for each of his IAM users. What should he do to achieve this? Explanation: The root owner should have physical access to the IAM user's MFA device (smartphone) to configure MFA. This is cumbersome and the better option is to let users configure and manage their own virtual MFA devices. For that, the owner must grant users permission to perform the necessary IAM actions.

- [ ] The owner needs a setup for each user's smartphone
- [ ] It is not possible to have MFA with a smartphone
- [ ] Enable MFA for each user and AWS will ask the user to attach their smartphone on the first login

- [x] Blank



### Question 761: A user has hosted a static website on the AWS S3 bucket with the URL: http://cloudacademy-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tests/aws_overview.html. The user has renamed the folder from test to quiz. The above link is referenced in 20 pages. How can the user migrate all the pages with ease? Explanation: In AWS S3, the user can conditionally route requests according to specific object key names, prefixes in the request, or the response code. In this case, when the user renames an object (with the folder name as a part of the key) in the bucket, you can add a routing rule that redirects the request to another object (with a new folder name).

Within the selected Availability Zone, it identifies the instance that matches the specified termination policy. (shw: C)

- [ ] Random instance from US-East-1B
- [ ] Instance with the nearest billing hour in US-East-1B

### Question 767: A user has enabled a static website with AWS S3. The user already has index.html as a part of this bucket. What difference will be there for the user while using this hosting feature? Explanation: To host a static website, the user needs to configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload the website contents to the bucket. The website is then available at the region-specific website endpoint of the bucket. If the user has an index.html object as part of the bucket, the user can always host it without the website hosting feature. However, it will require an absolute URL of the object. In this case, the user can access the whole bucket as a website and need not refer to individual objects separately.

- [ ] It helps the user to save some costs as it will not consider the I/O charges if website hosting is enabled
- [ ] Nothing. The website hosting feature just enables the user to point to the specific index file

Amazon EBS measures these I/O operations in 16 KB chunks. When the user provisions a 4,000 IOPS volume and attaches it to an EBS-optimized instance that can provide the necessary bandwidth, he can transfer 4,000 16 KB chunks of data per second (for a bandwidth of approximately 64 MBs or 512 Mbps). (shw: A)

- [ ] 4000
- [ ] 5000
- [ ] 1000
- [x] 2000



=IF(OR(ISNUMBER(FIND("[x] ", B5)), ISNUMBER(FIND("'[x] ", B5))), "A", "")

=IF(ISNUMBER(FIND("[x] ", B5)), "A", "")
