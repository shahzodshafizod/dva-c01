It is not possible to have it performed during the same time window as an automated backup. In case of a conflict, it will not allow launching an instance.

- [ ] RDS will launch the instance, but on Sunday it will take a backup only if there is no planned maintenance
- [ ] RDS will launch the instance, but on Sunday it will not take a backup
- [ ] RDS will launch the instance, but on Sunday it will not allow maintenance
- [x] RDS will not allow to launch the instance



### Question 703: A user is accessing an EC2 instance on the SSH port for IP 10.20.30.40. Which is a secure way to configure that the instance can be accessed only from this IP? Explanation: When configuring a security group within EC2, the user needs to specify the IP address in CIDR notation. The CIDR IP range 10.20.30.40/32 says it is for a single IP 10.20.30.40. If the user specifies the IP as 10.20.30.40 only, the security group will not accept and ask for it in a CIRD format.

- [ ] In the security group, open port 22 for IP 10.20.30.40
- [ ] In the security group, open port 22 for IP 10.20.30.40/0

### Question 704: A user has configured ELB with connection drainage. An instance is deregistering with ELB. In this particular case, what will be the status of a deregistered instance? Explanation: Connection draining causes the ELB load balancer to stop sending new requests to a deregistered instance or an unhealthy instance while keeping the existing connections open. While the in-flight requests are being served, the load balancer reports the instance state of the deregistered instance as InService: Instance deregistration is currently in progress. (shw: C)

- [ ] Deregistering: Instance deregistration currently in progress
- [ ] OutofService: Instance is deregistered
- [ ] InService: Instance deregistration currently in progress
- [x] OutOfService: Instance is not currently registered with the load balancer



### Question 705: A user has created an SSL-based ELB. If the user wants to bind the requestor session with the instance how can he enable this? Explanation: Generally a load balancer routes each request independently to the application instance with the smallest load. However, the user can enable the sticky session feature (also known as session affinity) which enables the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific application instance. The user can associate the stickiness duration for only the HTTP/HTTPS load balancer listeners. (shw: A)

- [ ] The SSL-based ELB does not support session stickiness with duration
- [ ] Use session stickiness with the ELB duration-based cookie
- [ ] Enable session stickiness with an SSL-based cookie
- [x] Enable session stickiness by using a TCP-based cookie



### Question 706: In regard to DynamoDB actions, which of the following statements best describes the meaning of "HTTP Status Code: 403"? Explanation: In DynamoDB, there are several actions that have HTTP status codes, and they help developers understand errors and the status of each action. for example: the "OptInRequired", which means the AWS access key ID needs a subscription for the service, and you see the HTTP status code 403.

- [ ] The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure.
- [ ] The request was denied due to request throttling.
- [x] The AWS access key ID needs a subscription for the service.

The I/O size, however, does make an impact on IOPS because of the way they are measured.

- [ ] Sequential I/O
- [x] I/O size
- [ ] Read/write I/O
- [ ] Random I/O



### Question 714: The user has created multiple AutoScaling groups. The user is trying to create a new AS group but it fails. How can the user know that he has reached the AS group limit specified by AutoScaling in that region? Explanation: A user can see the number of AutoScaling resources currently allowed for the AWS account either by using the as-describe-account-limits command or by calling the DescribeAccountLimits action.

- [ ] Run the command: as-max-account-limits
- [x] Run the command: as-describe-account-limits
- [ ] Run the command: as-list-account-limits
- [ ] Run the command: as-describe-group-limits



### Question 715: A user has configured two security groups that allow traffic as given below: 1: SecGrp1: - Inbound on port 80 for 0.0.0.0/0; - Inbound on port 22 for 0.0.0.0/0; 2: SecGrp2: - Inbound on port 22 for 10.10.10.1/32. If both the security groups are associated with the same instance, which of the below-mentioned statements is true? Explanation: A user can attach more than one security group to a single EC2 instance. In this case, the rules from each security group are effectively aggregated to create one set of rules. AWS uses this set of rules to determine whether to allow access or not. Thus, here the rule for port 22 with IP 10.10.10.1/32 will merge with IP 0.0.0.0/0 and open ports 22 and 80 for all. (shw: D)

- [ ] It is not possible to create a security group with conflicting rules. AWS will reject the request
- [ ] It is not possible to have more than one security group assigned to a single instance
- [x] It allows inbound traffic on port 22 for IP 10.10.10.1 and for everyone else on port 80

If you need to send messages to the queue that are larger than 8 KB, AWS recommends that you split the information into separate messages. Alternatively, you could use Amazon S3 or Amazon SimpleDB to hold the information and include the pointer to that information in the Amazon SQS message. If you send a message that is larger than 8KB to the queue, you will receive a MessageTooLong error with HTTP code 400.

- [ ] 16 KB
- [ ] 2 KB
- [ ] 4 KB
- [x] 8 KB



### Question 718: A user is thinking of using EBS standard volume. Which of the below-mentioned options is the right use case for that? Explanation: AWS EBS has two types of volumes. Standard and PIOPS. Standard volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for applications with light or burst I/O requirements. These volumes deliver approximately 100 IOPS on average, with burst capability of up to hundreds of IOPS. Some of the right use cases for standard EBS volumes are file servers, log processing, low-traffic websites, analytics, and system boot volume. (shw: D)

### Question 719: An organization has created an IAM user named cloud. The organization is trying to create a new group with the same name as cloud. What will happen in this case? Explanation: AWS resources are always identified by ARN. In this case, the ARN for the group will be arn:aws:iam::<Account ID>:group/cloud. While for the user it will be arn:aws:iam::<Account ID>:user/cloud. Thus, both will have separate ARNs so that the names will not conflict.

- [ ] AWS will not allow to create the IAM group with the name cloud as there will be a conflict between the ARNs
- [ ] AWS will allow to create the IAM group with the name cloud provided the user has given the path attribute name
- [ ] If the user is creating from CLI, it will allow since the user can specify the path attribute to a separate ARN
- [x] AWS will allow to create the IAM group with the name cloud as both the user and the group have separate ARNs



### Question 720: A user has launched an EBS-backed Linux instance. How can a user detach the root device and attach it to another instance as a secondary volume? Explanation: If an Amazon EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it cannot be detached unless the instance is in the stopped state. (shw: B)

- [ ] Unmount the root volume first and then detach it
- [ ] Stop the first instance and then attach the instance's root volume as a new volume to the other instance

### Question 723: An ELB has 8 instances registered with it. 4 instances are running in one AZ, while 2 each are running in two separate AZs. By default, when a user request arrives how will ELB distribute the load? Explanation: If the EC2 instances count is imbalanced across the AZ, the load balancer begins to route traffic equally amongst all the enabled Availability Zones irrespective of the instance count in each zone. If the user wants to distribute traffic equally amongst all the instances, the user needs to enable cross-zone load balancing. (shw: B)

- [ ] Distributing requests across all instances equally
- [ ] Distributing requests across all AZs equally irrespective of the instance count in each AZ
- [ ] The AZ with a higher instance will have more requests than others
- [x] The new request will go to the higher instance count AZ while the old requests will go to AZs with a lower number of instances



### Question 724: A user has created an application that sends data to a log file. The server hosting the log files can be unavailable for any reason. The user wants to make it so that whenever the log server is up it should be receiving the messages. Which of the below-mentioned AWS services helps achieve this functionality? Explanation: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, and fully managed message queuing service. SQS provides a simple and cost-effective way to decouple the components of an application. The user can use SQS to transmit any volume of data without losing messages or requiring other services to always be available. Using SQS, the application has to just send the data to SQS and SQS transmits it to the log file whenever it is available.

- [ ] AWS Simple Task Service
- [ ] AWS Simple Workflow



### Question 725: A user is trying to find the state of an S3 bucket with respect to versioning. Which of the below-mentioned states AWS will not return when queried? Explanation: S3 buckets can be in one of three states: unversioned (the default), versioning-enabled, or versioning-suspended. The bucket owner can configure the versioning state of a bucket. The versioning state applies to all (never some) of the objects in that bucket. The first time owner enables a bucket for versioning, objects in it are thereafter always versioned and given a unique version ID. (shw: D)

- [ ] versioning-suspended
- [x] unversioned
- [ ] versioning-enabled
- [ ] versioned



### Question 726: A user has hosted a website on AWS and uses ELB to load balance the multiple instances. The user application does not have any cookie management. How can the user bind the session of the requestor with a particular instance? Explanation: The key to managing the sticky session is determining how long the load balancer should route the user's request to the same application instance. If the application has its own session cookie, then the user can set the Elastic Load Balancing to create the session cookie to follow the duration specified by the application's session cookie. If the user's application does not have its own session cookie, then he can set the Elastic Load Balancing to create a session cookie by specifying his own stickiness duration.

- [ ] Create a cookie at the application level to set at ELB
- [ ] Bind the IP address with a sticky cookie
- [ ] Use session synchronization with ELB
- [x] Let ELB generate a cookie for a specified duration



### Question 727: A user has enabled versioning and has two versions of an S3 object with the IDs null and 111111. What will happen if the user suspends versioning and adds a new object? Explanation: If versioning is suspended, then S3 will create a new object with the ID as null for every subsequent object stored thereafter. If the object with a null ID already exists then S3 will overwrite it, but does not impact the other versions.

- [ ] S3 will overwrite the object with the ID 111111, but the object with the ID null stays intact
- [ ] All previous objects stay intact and S3 adds the third object as the latest version
- [ ] S3 will delete both the versioned objects and create a single copy of the object
- [x] S3 will overwrite the object with the ID as null, but the object with the ID 111111 will stay intact



### Question 728: How long are the messages kept on an SQS queue by default? Explanation: The SQS message retention period is configurable and can be set anywhere from 1 minute to 2 weeks. The default is 4 days and once the message retention limit is reached your messages will be automatically deleted. The option for longer message retention provides greater flexibility to allow for longer intervals between message production and consumption. (shw: B)

- [ ] If a message is not read, it is never deleted
- [ ] 4 days
- [ ] 1 day
- [x] 2 weeks

### Question 732: A user has set up an application on EC2 that uses the IAM user access key and secret access key to make secure calls to S3. The user wants to temporarily stop the access to S3 for that IAM user. What should the root owner do? Explanation: If the user wants to temporarily stop access to S3 the best solution is to disable the keys. Deleting the user will result in a loss of all the credentials and the app will not be useful in the future. If the user stops the instance IAM users can still access S3. The change of the key does not help either as they are still active. The best possible solution is to disable the keys.

- [x] Disable the access keys for the IAM user
- [ ] Delete the IAM user
- [ ] Change the access key and secret access key for the users
- [ ] Stop the instance



### Question 733: Can one instance be registered with two ELBs in the same region? Explanation: Yes, it is possible to have one instance part of two separate ELBs, though both ELBs have different configurations. ELBs are never launched in specific zones. (shw: B)

### Question 746: A user has enabled automated backup retention for 3 days on a PostgreSQL DB instance of RDS. The user deleted the RDS after 5 days. How many days of backup will be available in the RDS? Explanation: All automated backups are deleted and cannot be recovered when the user deletes an RDS DB instance. When the user deletes a DB instance, the user can create a final DB snapshot upon deletion; if it is done, the user can use this DB snapshot to restore the deleted DB instance at a later date. Amazon RDS retains this final user-created DB snapshot along with all other manually created DB snapshots after the DB instance is deleted. All automated backups are deleted and cannot be recovered when a DB instance is deleted.
