### Question 553: A user has created an S3 bucket named cloudacademy.com. The user is trying to access the publicly shared object photo.jpg using the URL: http:// cloudacademy.com .s3.amazonaws.com/photo.jpg. What will S3 return? Explanation: Amazon S3 supports virtual-hosted-style and path-style access in all regions. So the object can be accessed both as http://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudacademy.com/photo.jpg and as http://cloudacademy.com.s3.amazonaws.com/photo.jpg. The path-style syntax requires that the user should use the region-specific endpoint when attempting to access a bucket. Amazon S3 routes any virtual hosted-style requests to the US Standard region unless the user specifies the region-specific endpoint (for example, s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com).

- [x] It will show "photo.jpg"
- [ ] It will return an error with the message key not found
- [ ] It will throw an error saying invalid URL

### Question 557: What happens when a user takes a snapshot of an EBS volume which is not the first snapshot taken of the volume? Explanation: When a user creates a snapshot of an EBS volume which is not the first, it asynchronously copies the modified data only. It does not copy the whole volume or all the data written to it, but just the modified one. Only for the first snapshot, it will copy all the data written on the volume and not copy the blank/empty blocks. (shw: B)

- [ ] It synchronously copies incremental data to S3
- [ ] It copies only the modified data block of volume to S3
- [ ] It copies all the written blocks which are on the volume
- [x] It copies the whole EBS volume data to S3



### Question 558: A user has created a queue named "myqueue" with SQS. There are four messages published to the queue which are not received by the consumer yet. If the user tries to delete the queue, what will happen? Explanation: SQS allows the user to move data between distributed components of applications so they can perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. The user can delete a queue at any time, whether it is empty or not. It is important to note that queues retain messages for a set period of time. By default, a queue retains messages for four days.

- [ ] It will ask the user to delete the messages first
- [ ] It will initiate the delete but wait for four days before deleting until all messages are deleted automatically.
- [x] It will delete the queue
- [ ] A user can never delete a queue manually. AWS deletes it after 30 days of inactivity on the queue



### Question 559: In regards to Amazon SQS how can you secure the messages in your queues? Explanation: Authentication mechanisms are provided to ensure that messages stored in Amazon SQS queues are secured against unauthorized access. Only the AWS account owners can access the queues they create. Amazon SQS uses proven cryptographic methods to authenticate your identity, either through the use of your Access Key ID and request signature, or through the use of an X.509 certificate. (shw: A)

- [ ] Amazon SQS uses either your Access Key ID or an X.509 certificate to authenticate your identity
- [ ] Don't use root access
- [ ] You can't
- [x] Through your IAM access keys



### Question 560: A user has enabled versioning on the AWS S3 bucket. Inside the bucket, the user creates 950 versions of logo.jpg and 1050 versions of picture.jpg. If the user makes a call to get all the objects. How many objects will AWS S3 return? Explanation: To list all the versions of all the objects in a S3 bucket, the user must use the versions sub-resource in a GET Bucket request. Amazon S3 can only retrieve a maximum of 1000 objects, and each object version counts fully as an object. Therefore, in this case, a single request would retrieve all 950 versions of logo.jpg (based on name) and only the most recent 50 versions of picture.jpg. Amazon S3 returns versions of a single object in the order in which they were stored, with the most recently stored returned first.

- [ ] Single version of each
- [ ] First 50 versions of logo.jpg and first 50 versions of "picture.jpg"
- [ ] First 1000 versions of "picture.jpg"
- [x] First 950 versions of logo.jpg and first 50 versions of "picture.jpg"

### Question 562: A user has launched an EBS-backed instance. Can the user configure the instance, so that future instances will have ephemeral storage while creating the AMI? Explanation: In Amazon Web Services, when a user is creating an AMI from an EBS-backed instance, the user can configure to have ephemeral storage attached to future instances from the new AMI. This ephemeral storage is available for EBS-backed AMIs provided the instance size is not micro. All other instance types will have the ephemeral device attached on instance launch if they are configured during AMI creation. The new ephemeral storage will always be empty. (shw: C)

- [ ] No
- [ ] Yes, always
- [ ] Yes, provided the future instances are not micro size
- [x] Yes, provided the AMI is instance store backed



### Question 563: When should a user try to Force Detach an EBS volume? Explanation: If an EBS volume stays in the detaching state, the user can force the detachment by clicking Force Detach. Forcing the detachment can lead to either data loss or a corrupted file system. The user should use this option only as a last resort to detach a volume from a failed instance or if he is detaching a volume with the intention of deleting it.

- [ ] If the volume is not unmounted and the user still wants to detach
- [ ] If the volume is not accessible from the instance
- [ ] If the volume is a root volume
- [x] If the volume is stuck in a detaching state



### Question 564: In Amazon SNS, you can have up to _____ topics. Explanation: Amazon SNS currently supports up to 3,000 topics per AWS Account. To request a higher limit it is possible to contact Amazon. (shw: A)

### Question 567: A user has enabled Multi AZ deployment with MySQL RDS. The user has enabled the automated backup at 3 AM. Which of the below-mentioned statements is true with respect to the RDS automated backup? Explanation: During the RDS automated backup window, the storage I/O may be suspended while the data is being backed up and the user may experience elevated latency. This I/O suspension typically lasts for the duration of the snapshot. This period of I/O suspension is shorter for Multi AZ DB deployments since the backup is taken from the standby. However, latency can occur during the backup process.

- [ ] Take a snapshot from the master or replica based on the load on the DB
- [ ] Take a snapshot from the master, but the replica will serve requests during a snapshot
- [ ] Take a snapshot from the replica, but the master will be frozen to avoid data inconsistency
- [x] Take a snapshot from standby



### Question 568: A user is planning to host data with RDS. Which of the below-mentioned databases is not supported by RDS? Explanation: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. AWS RDS supports popular DBs, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, and Oracle. This means that the code, applications, and tools the user is already using with existing databases can be used with Amazon RDS too. In short, it is a managed Relation Database offering from AWS that manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery of the Database.

- [ ] PostgreSQL
- [x] SQLDB
- [ ] MS SQL
- [ ] Oracle



### Question 569: You need to develop and run some new applications on AWS, and you know that Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation can both help as a deployment mechanism for a broad range of AWS resources. Which of the following statements best describes the differences between Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation? Explanation: These services are designed to complement each other. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment to easily develop and run applications in the cloud. It is integrated with developer tools and provides a one-stop experience for you to manage the lifecycle of your applications. AWS CloudFormation is a convenient deployment mechanism for a broad range of AWS resources. It supports the infrastructure needs of many different types of applications such as existing enterprise applications, legacy applications, applications built using a variety of AWS resources, and container-based solutions (including those built using AWS Elastic Beanstalk). AWS CloudFormation introduces two new concepts: The template, a JSON-format, text-based file that describes all the AWS resources you need to deploy to run your application, and the stack, the set of AWS resources that are created and managed as a single unit when AWS CloudFormation instantiates a template. (shw: A)

- [ ] CloudFormation is much more powerful than Elastic Beanstalk because you can actually design and script custom resources
- [ ] Elastic Beanstalk is faster in deploying applications than CloudFormation.

### Question 584: You are building an online store on AWS that uses SQS to process your customer orders. Your backend system needs those messages in the same sequence the customer orders have been put in. How can you achieve that? Explanation: Amazon SQS is engineered to always be available and deliver messages. One of the resulting tradeoffs is that SQS does not guarantee first-in, first-out delivery of messages. For many distributed applications, each message can stand on its own, and as long as all messages are delivered, the order is not important. If your system requires that order be preserved, you can place sequencing information in each message, so that you can reorder the messages when the queue returns them. (shw: A)

- [ ] You can use sequencing information on each message
- [ ] You can do this with SQS but you also need to use SWF
- [ ] It is not possible to do this with SQS
- [x] Messages will arrive in the same order by default



### Question 585: Regarding Amazon SQS, are there restrictions on the names of Amazon SQS queues? Explanation: Queue names are limited to 80 characters. Alphanumeric characters plus hyphens (-) and underscores (_) are allowed. Queue names must be unique within an AWS account. After you delete a queue, you can reuse the queue name. (shw: C)

- [ ] No
- [x] Yes. Queue names must be unique within an AWS account and you cannot use hyphens (-) and underscores (_)
- [ ] Yes. Queue names are limited to 80 characters and queue names must be unique within an AWS account
- [ ] Yes. Queue names are limited to 80 characters but queue names do not need to be unique within an AWS account



### Question 586: Which of the below-mentioned options is not a best practice to securely manage the AWS access credentials? Explanation: It is a recommended approach to avoid using the access and secret access keys of the root account. Thus, do not download or delete it. Instead, make the IAM user as powerful as the root account and use its credentials. The user cannot generate their own access and secret access keys as they are always generated by AWS.

- [ ] Keep rotating your secure access credentials at regular intervals
- [ ] If you have the root account keys, delete them
- [x] Create a strong access key and secret access key and attach them to the root account
- [ ] Never share the secure keys with anyone



### Question 587: Is there a limit to how much throughput you can get out of a single table in DynamoDB? Explanation: In DynamoDB, you can increase the throughput you have provisioned for your table using UpdateTable API or in the AWS Management Console. If you wish to exceed throughput rates of 10,000 writes/second or 10,000 reads/second, you must first contact AWS. (shw: A)

- [ ] No, but If you wish to exceed throughput rates of 10,000 writes/second or 10,000 reads/second, you must first contact AWS.
- [ ] Yes, not more than 10,000 writes/second or 10,000 reads/second
- [ ] No
- [x] Yes, not more than 1,000 writes/second or 1,000 reads/second



### Question 588: To scale up the AWS resources using manual AutoScaling, which of the below-mentioned parameters should the user change? Explanation: Manual Scaling as part of Auto Scaling allows the user to change the capacity of the Auto Scaling group. The user can add/remove EC2 instances on the fly. To execute manual scaling, the user should modify the desired capacity. AutoScaling will adjust instances as per the requirements. If the user is trying to CLI, he can use the command: as-set-desired-capacity <Auto Scaling Group Name> --desired-capacity <New Capacity> (shw: C)

- [ ] Current capacity
- [x] Maximum capacity
- [ ] Desired capacity
- [ ] Preferred capacity



### Question 589: A user is trying to share a video file with all his friends. Which of the below-mentioned AWS services will be the cheapest and easiest to use?

It provides less durability than S3 but is a cheaper option. (shw: B)

- [x] AWS S3
- [ ] AWS RRS
- [ ] AWS Glacier
- [ ] AWS EC2



### Question 590: A user has launched a website on an EC2-Classic instance with Apache. If the user wants to access a DB hosted on another instance how will he allow traffic to access the DB securely from the source webserver instance? Explanation: When a user is configuring the security group, the user can either specify the CIDR-based IP or a security group in the source. Since this is EC2-Classic, by default all outbound traffic is enabled. An Open port for IP 0.0.0.0/0 is not recommended considering the security risk. The best option is to configure a security group of the DB instance that allows inbound traffic from the Webserver security group. When the user specifies a security group as the source or destination for a rule, the rule affects all the instances associated with that security group.

- [ ] Open port 0.0.0.0/0 in the DB instance security group for the DB port
- [ ] Open the outbound traffic on the DB port from the webserver instance to connect to the DB instance IP
- [ ] Open the inbound DB port on the Webserver instance for the DB server Instance IP
- [x] Configure the DB instance security group where it will allow traffic on the DB port from the webserver instance security group



### Question 591: In regards to Amazon SQS how many times will you receive each message? Explanation: Amazon SQS is engineered to provide "at least once" delivery of all messages in its queues. Although most of the time, each message will be delivered to your application exactly once, you should design your system so that processing a message more than once does not create any errors or inconsistencies. (shw: A)

- [ ] At least once
- [ ] As many times as you want
- [ ] At least twice
- [x] Exactly once



### Question 592: A user has configured a security group with EC2-CLASSIC. Which of the below-mentioned statements is true? Explanation: When a user has created a security group with EC2-CLASSIC, by default all inbound is disabled, and outbound is enabled for that group. (shw: A)

- [ ] By default all inbound traffic is disabled and all outbound traffic is enabled
- [ ] By default all inbound and outbound traffic is enabled
- [ ] By default all inbound and outbound traffic is disabled
- [x] By default all inbound traffic is enabled and all outbound traffic is disabled



### Question 593: A user is creating a custom firewall configuration in EC2-Classic. How will the user ensure that the internal DNS resolution of the instance does not fail? Explanation: In Amazon Web Services, if a user is creating a custom firewall configuration in EC2-Classic, the user must allow inbound traffic from port 53 (with a destination port from the ephemeral range) from the address of the Amazon DNS server. Otherwise, the internal DNS resolution from the user's instances fails. If the firewall does not automatically allow the DNS query responses, then the user needs to allow traffic from the IP address of the Amazon DNS server. To get the IP address of the Amazon DNS server on Linux, use the following command: grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf. To get the IP address of the Amazon DNS Server on Windows, use the following command: ipconfig /all | findstr /c:"DNS Servers". (shw: A)

- [ ] Allow inbound traffic on port 53 from the Amazon DNS server.
- [ ] The custom firewall should map the internal DNS with the elastic IP using NAT.
- [ ] The user should implement NAT for DNS and IP mapping.
- [x] The user cannot create a custom firewall in EC2-Classic.



### Question 594: A user is planning to launch multiple EC2 instances the same as the current running instance. Which of the below-mentioned parameters is not copied by AWS EC2 in the launch wizard when the user has selected the option "Launch more like this"? Explanation: The Amazon EC2 console provides a "Launch more like this" wizard option that enables the user to use a current instance as a template for launching other instances. This option automatically populates the Amazon EC2 launch wizard with certain configuration details from the selected instance. The user data is not copied by AWS. (shw: B)

- [ ] Security Group
- [ ] User data
- [ ] Amazon EBS-optimization setting
- [x] IAM role



### Question 595: A user has enabled static website hosting for the AWS S3 bucket. Which of the below-mentioned statements is not true? Explanation: To host a static website, the user needs to configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload the website content to the bucket. The website endpoint is optimized for access from a web browser. It returns an HTML document as error handling, but not in the XML format. (shw: C)

- [x] It does not support SSL connections
- [ ] It supports Get and HEAD requests
- [ ] It returns an XML-formatted error response
- [ ] It supports redirection



### Question 596: An IAM user has two conflicting policies as part of two separate groups. One policy allows him to access an S3 bucket, while another policy denies him access. Can the user access that bucket? Explanation: When a request is made, the AWS IAM policy decides whether a given request should be allowed or denied. The evaluation logic follows these rules: - By default, all requests are denied. (In general, requests made using the account credentials for resources in the account are always allowed.) - An explicit allow policy overrides this default. - An explicit deny policy overrides any allowances. - In this case, since there is an explicit deny policy, it will override everything and the request will be denied.

- [ ] Yes, provided he accesses the group which has S3 access
- [x] No
- [ ] Yes, always
- [ ] Yes, but just read-only access to the bucket



### Question 597: What is the maximum number of tags that a user can assign to an EC2 instance? Explanation: To help manage EC2 instances as well as their usage in a better way, the user can tag the instances. The tags are metadata assigned by the user which consists of a key and a value. One resource can have a maximum of 10 tags. (shw: A)

- [ ] 10
- [ ] 50
- [ ] 5
- [x] 25



### Question 598: With regard to DynamoDB, increases in the throughput level of a table will typically ____________. Explanation: In general in DynamoDB, decreases in throughput will take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, while increases in throughput will typically take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. (shw: C)

- [ ] Take around a few seconds.
- [x] Be immediate.
- [ ] Take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
- [ ] Take 24 hours.



### Question 599: A user wants to configure AutoScaling which scales up when the CPU utilization is above 70% and scales down when the CPU utilization is below 30%. How can the user configure AutoScaling for the above-mentioned condition? Explanation: The user can configure the AutoScaling group to automatically scale up and then scale down based on the specified conditions. To configure this, the user must set up policies that will get triggered by the CloudWatch alarms.

- [ ] Use AutoScaling by manually modifying the desired capacity during a condition
- [ ] Use AutoScaling with a schedule
- [ ] Configure ELB to notify AutoScaling on load increase or decrease
- [x] Use dynamic AutoScaling with a policy



### Question 600: True or False: In DynamoDB, Scan operations are always eventually consistent. Explanation: In DynamoDB, Scan operations are always eventually consistent. (shw: A)

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No, you can optionally request a strongly consistent scan
- [ ] No, the scan is like a Query operation
- [ ] No, the scan is strongly consistent by default
