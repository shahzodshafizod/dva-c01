### Question 451: A user is configuring AutoScaling to scale up at 9 AM every day. The user has another policy that scales up the instance on the 1st of every month at 9 AM. What will AutoScaling do in this scenario? Explanation: For AutoScaling, scaling based on a schedule allows the user to scale an application in response to predictable load changes. A scheduled action must have a unique time value. If the user attempts to schedule an activity at a time when another existing activity is already scheduled, the call will be rejected with an error message noting the conflict. The user can create scheduled actions for scaling only one time or for scaling on a recurring schedule.

- [ ] AutoScaling will allow the policy but will give an error on the 1st date of the next month
- [ ] AutoScaling will launch two instances on the 1st of every month
- [ ] AutoScaling will launch only 1 instance on the 1st of every month
- [x] AutoScaling will not allow to create the policy since it conflicts with time

### Question 483: How does Amazon SQS allow multiple readers to access the same message queue without losing messages or processing them many times? Explanation: Every Amazon SQS queue has a configurable visibility timeout. For the designated amount of time after a message is read from a queue, it will not be visible to any other reader. As long as the amount of time that it takes to process the message is less than the visibility timeout, every message will be processed and deleted. In the event that the component processing the message fails or becomes unavailable, the message will again become visible to any component reading the queue once the visibility timeout ends. This allows you to have many components all reading messages from the same queue, with each working to process different messages.

- [x] Amazon SQS queue has a configurable visibility timeout.
- [ ] Multiple readers can't access the same message queue
- [ ] By using unique cryptography
- [ ] By identifying a user by his unique ID



### Question 484: Which of the below-mentioned options ensures that the user requests are always attached to a single instance? Explanation: Generally an Elastic Load Balancer routes each request independently to the application instance with the smallest load. However, the user can enable the sticky session feature (also known as session affinity) which enables the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific application instance. This ensures that all requests coming from the user during the session will be sent to the same application instance.

- [ ] Session cookie
- [ ] Connection drainage
- [x] Session affinity
- [ ] Cross zone load balancing



### Question 485: A user has launched 5 EC2 instances inside a placement group. The user first stopped three instances and then started them after 60 minutes. Which of the below-mentioned statements is true? Explanation: A placement group is a logical grouping of EC2 instances within a single Availability Zone. Placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. If the user stops an instance in a placement group and then starts it again, it still runs in the placement group. However, the start fails if enough capacity is not there for the available instance in EC2. In this case, if there is no capacity it will not launch the instances. (shw: A)

- [ ] All running instances will still be a part of the same placement group
- [ ] The user cannot start/stop instances inside the placement group

- [ ] It is stored in the same AZ as the volume
- [ ] It can be used to launch a new instance
- [ ] It is a point-in-time backup of the EBS volume
- [x] It's incremental



### Question 487: A user has launched 5 EBS-backed instances as part of the placement group. The user wants to move one instance out of the placement group and move it to another placement group. How can he achieve this? Explanation: The AWS EC2 placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. Placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. The user cannot merge or migrate placement groups. Instead, the user must terminate the instances in one placement group, and then re-launch those instances into another placement group.

- [ ] Stop the instance and then change the instance placement group
- [x] It is not possible to move instances across placement groups
- [ ] Terminate unnecessary instances and merge the new placement group with the old one
- [ ] The user can migrate an instance with ec2-migrate-placement-group functionality



### Question 488: A user is sharing the AWS AMI with selected users. Will the new user be able to create a volume from the shared AMI?

Explanation: If a user wants the URL of the AWS IAM sign-in page to have a company name instead of the AWS account ID, he can create an alias for his AWS account ID. The alias should be unique.

- [ ] Create the S3 bucket with an alias name and use the redirect rule to forward requests to various accounts
- [ ] Create the same account alias with each account ID
- [x] It is not possible to have the same IAM account login URL for separate AWS accounts
- [ ] Merge all the accounts with consolidated billing



### Question 491: A user has configured a bucket S3 to host a static website. What difference will there be when static website hosting is enabled? Explanation: To host a static website, the user needs to configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload the website contents to the bucket. The website is then available at the region-specific website endpoint of the bucket.

- [ ] It will help the user identify this bucket as the website root to map with the domain
- [ ] It will create a new version of the bucket
- [x] It will provide the region-specific website endpoint
- [ ] It will not make any difference but will help the user configure the error page
