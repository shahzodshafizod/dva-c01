- [x] Yes
- [ ] No



### Question 402: An organization has created 10 IAM users. The organization wants those users to work independently and access AWS. Which of the below-mentioned options is not a possible solution? Explanation: If an organization has created the IAM users, the users can access AWS services either with an IAM-specific login/password or console. The organization can generate the IAM X.509 certificates to access AWS with CLI. The organization can also enable MFA for each IAM user, which allows added security for each IAM user. If the organization has created the access key and secret key then the user cannot access the console using those keys. Access key and secret access key are useful for CLI or Webservices. (shw: A)

- [ ] Create the access key and secret access key for each user and provide access to AWS using the console
- [ ] Create the X.509 certificate for each user and provide them access to AWS CLI
- [ ] Provide each user with the IAM login and password for the AWS console
- [x] Enable MFA for each IAM user and assign them the virtual MFA device to access the console



### Question 403: A user has configured AutoScaling with policy-based scaling. The user has 68 instances running right now. The policy states that the count should be increased by 10%. How many instances will be running after the scaling activity is complete? Explanation: AutoScaling rounds off the values returned by the PercentChangeInCapacity to the lower number if the value is positive. If the current count is 68 and the policy gets executed, the total number of instances to be added will be calculated as 6.8 (10% of 68). AWS will round it off to 6 and launch 6 more instances. (shw: C)

### Question 405: Cloudacademy (with AWS account ID 111122223333) has created 50 IAM users for its organization's employees. What will be the AWS console URL for these associates? Explanation: When an organization is using AWS IAM for creating various users and managing their access rights, the IAM user can not use the login URL http://aws.amazon.com/console to access the AWS management console. The console login URL for the IAM user will have the AWS account ID of that organization to identify the IAM user belonging to a particular account. The AWS console login URL for the IAM user will be https:// <AWS_Account_ID>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/. In this case, it will be https:// 111122223333.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/

- [x] https://111122223333.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
- [ ] https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
- [ ] https://signin.aws.amazon.com/111122223333/console/
- [ ] https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console/111122223333/



### Question 406: A user has enabled session stickiness with application-controlled stickiness. If the instance with which the user's session was bound becomes unhealthy, what will ELB do? Explanation: If an application server fails or is removed, the Elastic Load Balancer will try to route the sticky session to another healthy application server. The load balancer will try to stick to a new healthy application server and continue routing to the currently sick application server even after the failed application server comes back. However, it is up to the new application server how it will respond to a request that it has not seen previously.

- [ ] ELB will try for a while to send to the same instance before giving a session timeout
- [ ] ELB will throw an error since the instance with which the session was bound has failed
- [ ] ELB will take the user to the error page configured with ELB
- [x] ELB will stick a request to a new healthy instance by routing a request to it



### Question 407: In regard to DynamoDB actions, which one of the following statements explains the meaning of "HTTP Status Code: 500"? Explanation: In DynamoDB, there are several actions that have HTTP status codes that help developers understand errors and the status of each action. for example: the "InternalFailure", which means the request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure, will return the HTTP status code 500.

- [ ] The request has failed due to a temporary failure of the server.

- [x] In AutoScaling launch configuration



### Question 409: How can a user list the IAM Role configured as a part of the launch config? Explanation: As-describe-launch-configs describes all the launch config parameters created by the AWS account in the specified region. Generally, it returns values, such as Launch Config name, Instance Type, and AMI ID. If the user wants additional parameters, such as the IAM Profile used in the config, he has to run the command: as-describe-launch-configs --show-long

- [ ] `as-describe-launch-configs --iam-profile`

### Question 411: A user has defined an AutoScaling termination policy to first delete the oldest instance.

One of the instances in the US-East-1B region is running nearest to the billing hour while the instance in the US-East-1A region is the oldest one. Which instance will AutoScaling terminate first while executing the termination action? Explanation: Even though the user has configured the termination policy before AutoScaling selects an instance to terminate, it first identifies the Availability Zone that has more instances than the other Availability Zones used by the group. If both the zones have the same instance count it will select the zone randomly. Within the selected Availability Zone, it identifies the instance that matches the specified termination policy. In this case, it will identify the AZ randomly and then first delete the oldest instance from that zone which matches the termination policy. (shw: B)

- [ ] Deletes the oldest instance from US-EAST-1AB
- [ ] Randomly selects the AZ and then terminates the oldest instance
- [x] Deletes the oldest instance from US-EAST-1A

- [x] Yes, by enabling the HTTPS listener
- [ ] Yes, but only at the EC2 instance level
- [ ] Yes, by installing the SSL certificate on ELB
- [ ] No



### Question 413: A bucket owner has allowed another account's IAM users to upload or access objects in his bucket. The IAM user of Account A is trying to access an object created by the IAM user of Account B. What will happen in this scenario? Explanation: If an IAM user is trying to perform some action on an object belonging to another AWS user's bucket, S3 will verify whether the owner of the IAM user has given sufficient permission to him. It also verifies the policy for the bucket as well as the policy defined by the object owner.

- [ ] The bucket policy may not be created as S3 will give an error due to a conflict of Access Rights
- [ ] It is not possible to give permission to multiple IAM users
- [x] AWS S3 will verify proper rights given by the owner of Account A, the bucket owner, as well as by the IAM user B to the object

The unhealthy instance becomes healthy again after 10 minutes. What will ELB do in this case? Explanation: If an application server fails or is removed, the Elastic Load Balancer will try to route the sticky session to another healthy application server. The load balancer will try to stick to a new healthy application server and continue routing to the currently sick application server even after the failed application server comes back. However, it is up to the new application server how it will respond to a request that it has not seen previously.
