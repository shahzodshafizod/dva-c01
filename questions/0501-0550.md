### Question 501: AutoScaling is configured with 3 AZs. Each zone has 5 instances running. If AutoScaling wants to terminate an instance based on the policy action, which instance will it terminate first? Explanation: Before Auto Scaling selects an instance to terminate, it first identifies the Availability Zone that has more instances than the other Availability Zones used by the group. If all the Availability Zones have the same number of instances, it identifies a random Availability Zone. (shw: C)

- [ ] Terminate the instance from the AZ which does not have a high AWS load
- [ ] Terminate the first launched instance
- [ ] Randomly select the instance for termination
- [x] Terminate the instance from the AZ which has instances running near the billing hour



### Question 502: A user has launched an EC2 micro instance from the AWS Linux image. When the user is trying to SSH the instance, it gives a message "No supported Authentication Method" after the user enters the user ID ec2-user. Which of the below-mentioned options is a possible reason for the error? Explanation: If the user has launched an EC2 Linux instance without attaching a key-pair he will be unable to connect to that instance and will receive the "No supported Authentication Method" error.

- [x] The user might not have attached the key-pair with the EC2 instance
- [ ] The instance default user name is wrong
- [ ] Port 22 is not open for the instance security group
- [ ] The instance is not configured for security



### Question 503: If you want your VPC to use a different set of DHCP options, ______. Explanation: The values of a DHCP option set cannot be modified after being created. Instead, new sets of DHCP options can be created to replace those currently associated with your VPC.

- [ ] You have to make a copy of the existing DHCP options and modify it.
- [ ] None of these.
- [x] You must create a new set of DHCP options and associate them with your VPC.

- [ ] AWS APIs
- [x] Subscribers
- [ ] AWS services
- [ ] Publishers



### Question 506: A user is setting up an Elastic Load Balancer(ELB). Which of the below parameters should the user consider so that the instance gets registered with the ELB? Explanation: The EC2 instances are registered with the load balancer using the IP addresses associated with the instances. When an instance is stopped and then started, the IP address associated with the instance changes. This prevents the load balancer from routing traffic to the restarted instance. When the user stops and then starts registering EC2 instances, it is recommended to de-register the stopped instance from the load balancer, and then register the restarted instance. Failure to do so may prevent the load balancer from performing health checks and routing the traffic to the restarted instance.

- [ ] ELB DNS
- [x] IP address
- [ ] Security Group
- [ ] ELB IP



### Question 507: A user has created a bucket with the name "cloudacademy" in the US East region. Another AWS account user is trying to create a bucket with the same name in the EU region. What will S3 do? Explanation: S3 bucket names must be unique through all AWS regions. (shw: B)

- [ ] It will throw an error saying naming criteria are not met for the EU region
- [ ] It will throw an error saying the requested bucket name is not available
- [ ] It will allow the other AWS owner to create since the AWS account ID is different
- [x] It will allow the other AWS owner to create since the region is different



### Question 508: In DynamoDB, when the entire result set from a query or scan has been processed, _____. Explanation: This indicates that the result set is complete (i.e. the operation processed the "last page" of data).

- [ ] the ExclusiveStartKey is null.
- [ ] the LastEvaluatedKey and ExclusiveStartKey are null.
- [ ] the ExclusiveStartKey is equal to LastEvaluatedKey.
- [x] the LastEvaluatedKey is null.



### Question 509: In relation to Amazon SQS, how can you ensure that messages are delivered in order? Explanation: Amazon SQS makes the best effort to preserve order in messages, but due to the distributed nature of the queue, AWS cannot guarantee that you will receive messages in the exact order you sent them. You typically place sequencing information or timestamps in your messages so that you can reorder them upon receipt.

- [x] AWS cannot guarantee that you will receive messages in the exact order you sent them
- [ ] Send them with a timestamp
- [ ] Give each message a unique ID
- [ ] Increase the size of your queue



### Question 510: The user has provisioned the PIOPS volume with an EBS-optimized instance. Generally speaking, in which I/O chunk should the bandwidth experienced by the user be measured by AWS?

- [x] 256 KB
- [ ] 64 KB
- [ ] 128 KB
- [ ] 32 KB



### Question 511: Which of the below-mentioned statements is false with respect to the public DNS of an EC2 instance? Explanation: When a user has launched an EC2 instance, AWS assigns a public and a private DNS to the instance. Both the private and public DNS are mapped using NAT. The EBS-backed instance, if started/stopped, will always have a new public and private DNS. However, an instance store-backed AMI will have only a single public DNS throughout the lifecycle as they cannot be re-started/stopped. (shw: A)

- [ ] It is linked to the user's AWS account.
- [ ] It is mapped to the primary network interface.
- [ ] The public DNS cannot be changed by the user.
- [x] It can be used to access the instance from the internet.



### Question 512: Can a user associate and use his own DNS with ELB instead of the DNS provided by AWS ELB? Explanation: The AWS ELB allows mapping a custom domain name with ELB. The user can map ELB with DNS in two ways: 1) By creating CNAME with the existing domain name service provider or 2) By creating a record with Route 53.

- [ ] Yes, by configuring DNS in the AWS Console
- [x] Yes, by creating a CNAME with the existing domain name provider
- [ ] No
- [ ] Yes, only through Route 53 by mapping ELB and DNS



### Question 513: A user is enabling static website hosting on an S3 bucket. Which below-mentioned parameters cannot be configured by the user? Explanation: To host a static website, the user needs to configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload the website contents to the bucket. The user can configure the index, error document as well as configure the conditional routing of an object name. (shw: B)

- [ ] Error document
- [ ] Conditional error on object name
- [x] Conditional redirection on object name
- [ ] Index document



### Question 514: A user has stored an object in RRS. The object is lost due to an internal AWS failure. What will AWS return when someone queries the object? Explanation: If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object.

- [ ] AWS will serve the object from backup
- [ ] The object cannot be lost as RRS is highly durable
- [x] 405 Method Not Allowed error
- [ ] 404 Object Not Found error



### Question 515: A user has launched one EC2 instance in the US West region. The user wants to access the RDS instance launched in the US East region from that EC2 instance. How can the user configure the access for that EC2 instance? Explanation: The user cannot authorize an Amazon EC2 security group if it is in a different AWS Region than the RDS DB instance. The user can authorize an IP range or specify an Amazon EC2 security group in the same region that refers to an IP address in another region.

- [ ] Open the security group of the US West region in the RDS security group's ingress rule
- [ ] It is not possible to access the RDS of the US East region from the US West region
- [ ] Create an IAM role that has access to RDS and launch an instance in the US West region with it
- [x] Configure the IP range of the US West region instance as the ingress security rule of RDS



### Question 516: A user has hosted an application on EC2. The user wants to configure EC2 to send requests for DB to the MySQL RDS on port 3306. However, RDS returns the response on port 3372. How can the user configure this? Explanation: When the user specifies an EC2 security group as the source, he is allowing incoming traffic from all the EC2 instances that use that particular EC2 security group. The DB security group rules apply only to inbound traffic; outbound traffic is not currently permitted for the DB instances.

- [ ] Configure the outbound port for RDS as 3372 using VPC
- [ ] Configure RDS my.conf file, which returns data on 3372
- [ ] Port 3372 is reserved for PostgreSQL. Try another port in the outbound traffic of the security group
- [x] It is not possible to configure the outbound port for RDS



### Question 517: A user has attached an EBS volume created from an existing snapshot to a running instance. The volume is not mounted on the instance yet. If the user takes a snapshot of the attached volume, what will happen? Explanation: When a user creates an EBS volume from a snapshot it will have all the contents of the original volume. When the volume is attached but not mounted the user cannot write on that volume. In this case, when the user takes a snapshot it will succeed but will have only the original contents of the volume since the data may not have been modified.

- [x] The new snapshot will only have the original volume content
- [ ] The snapshot will succeed with all the modified data of the EBS volume
- [ ] The snapshot will fail since the volume is not mounted
- [ ] The snapshot will succeed but it will have no data



### Question 518: A user is planning to launch an instance from AWS EC2. Which of the below-mentioned options is not a possible scenario?

The ELB console does not allow launching an instance but only allows adding/removing an instance from ELB.

- [ ] Launch an instance using the EC2 CLI.
- [x] Launch using the ELB console with the selected AMI.
- [ ] Launch an instance using the Amazon EBS snapshot.
- [ ] Use the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell with an AMI that the user selects.



### Question 519: A user has enabled the TCP/SSL listener for an ELB. Which protocol header helps identify the IP address of the client? Explanation: The Proxy Protocol header helps you identify the IP address of a client when the user is using a load balancer configured for the TCP/SSL connections. The load balancers intercept traffic between clients and back-end instances since they face the client's internet traffic. The access logs from the back-end instance contain the IP address of the load balancer instead of the originating client. When Proxy Protocol is enabled, the load balancer adds a human-readable format header that contains the connection information, such as the source IP address, destination IP address, and port numbers of the client. The header is then sent to the back-end instance as a part of the request. The user can parse the first line of the request to retrieve your client's IP address and port number.

- [ ] Client IP
- [x] Proxy Protocol
- [ ] X-Forwarded-For
- [ ] TCP-Client-IP



### Question 520: Which of the below-mentioned statements is true with respect to the AWS EC2? Explanation: When a user has launched an EC2 instance, AWS assigns a public and a private DNS to the instance. Both the private and public DNS are mapped using NAT. The EBS-backed instance if started/stopped will always have a new public and private DNS. However, an instance store-backed AMI will only have a single public DNS throughout the lifecycle as they cannot be re-started/stopped. (shw: B)

- [ ] The user has to use only the Elastic IP with an instance store-backed AMI instance.
- [ ] The instance launched from an instance store-backed AMI will always have a fixed public DNS for the life of the instance.
- [ ] The instance launched from an EBS-backed AMI will always have a fixed public DNS for the life of the instance.
- [x] The private IP address and public IP address for an instance are not directly mapped to each other



### Question 521: When selecting an AMI to launch the EC2 instance, which of the below-mentioned options is not available to the user? Explanation: When launching an EC2 instance, the user needs to select either an own AMI or an AMI from the AWS marketplace. The other option is to select Community public AMIs shared by the AWS community members. There is no option, such as AWS Trusted partners. (shw: B)

- [ ] Select My AMIs.
- [ ] Select from the Trusted AWS partners.
- [ ] Select Community AMIs.
- [x] Select from the AWS marketplace.



### Question 522: By using __________, you simply upload your application, and it automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

- [ ] Amazon CloudFront
- [x] AWS Elastic Beanstalk



### Question 523: A user is using an EBS-backed Windows instance. The user wants the instance to terminate when he stops the instance. How can the user achieve this? Explanation: In Amazon Web Services, each EBS-backed instance has the instance shutdown behavior attribute. It allows the instance to terminate/stop when the instance is stopped. By default, it is set to stop, but the user can change this attribute such that in the future when someone stops the instance it gets terminated.

- [x] Change the shutdown behavior of the instance from stop to terminate.
- [ ] Update the instance termination protection attributes so it always terminates when it is stopped.
- [ ] The user has to use CloudWatch to configure instance termination while the instance is being stopped.
- [ ] It is not possible to terminate the instance when it is stopped.



### Question 524: A user is trying to create a list of IAM users with the AWS console. When the IAM users are created which of the below-mentioned credentials will be enabled by default for the user? Explanation: Newly created IAM users have no password and no access key (access key ID and secret access key). If the user needs to administer your AWS resources using the AWS Management Console, you can create a password for the user. If the user needs to interact with AWS programmatically (using the command line interface (CLI), the AWS SDK, or service-specific APIs), you can create an access key for that user. The credentials you create for users are what they use to uniquely identify themselves to AWS. (shw: C)

- [ ] IAM passwords
- [ ] IAM X.509 certificates
- [ ] Nothing. Everything is disabled by default
- [x] IAM access key and secret access key



### Question 525: An EBS volume was unable to detach from an instance. Thus, the user used the Force Detach option. Which of the below-mentioned options can happen after the volume has been Forcibly detached? Explanation: If the EBS volume stays in the detaching state, the user can force the detachment by clicking Force Detach. Forcing the detachment can lead to either data loss or a corrupted file system. The user should use this option only as a last resort to detach a volume from a failed instance or if he is detaching a volume with the intention of deleting it. The instance does not get an opportunity to flush file system caches or file system metadata. If the user uses this option, he must perform a file system check and repair the procedures.

- [x] The instance may not be able to flush the file system and may result in a corrupted file system of the volume
- [ ] AWS deletes the volume automatically since it will be in a corrupted state
- [ ] AWS terminates the instance automatically since the file system is corrupted
- [ ] The volume will be available but cannot be attached to any instance in the future



### Question 526: A user has launched an instance with an EBS-backed root device and then attached two additional EBS volumes to it. The user is trying to create the AutoScaling Launch configuration using this instance as a reference. How many additional block devices will the future instance have by default? Explanation: When a user is creating a new launch configuration from the existing instance, AS will take all the parameters except the instance ID and config name from the existing instance. The launch config though, will not take the new block device mapping into consideration and instead use the one which was the default one with AMI. In this case, there was no additional block device with EBS. Thus, the future EBS will have 0 additional EBS volumes

- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
- [ ] 3
- [x] 0



### Question 527: A user has launched an EC2 instance under the free usage tier. The user wants to create 2 large instances by creating the AMI from the same instance. Can the large instances automatically have ephemeral storage attached to them? Explanation: When a user is creating an AMI from an EBS-backed instance, the user can be configured to have ephemeral storage attached to future instances from the new AMI. This ephemeral storage is available for EBS-backed AMIs provided the instance size is not micro. All other instance types will have the ephemeral device attached on instance launch if they are configured during AMI creation.

- [ ] Yes, but while creating the AMI save it instance store-backed
- [ ] No, the EBS-backed instance can never have ephemeral storage
- [x] Yes, provided the user is configured to have ephemeral storage during the AMI creation
- [ ] No, the AMI created from the micro instance can never have ephemeral storage



### Question 528: A user has set up Multi AZ with the MS SQL RDS instance. Which of the below-mentioned functionalities can be achieved by the user? Explanation: The Multi AZ feature allows the user to achieve High Availability. MS SQL does not support Multi AZ.

### Question 529: An account owner has created an IAM user with the name cloudacademy. The account owner wants to give EC2 access only to the US West region to that IAM user. How can the owner configure this? Explanation: The IAM policy is never region-specific. If the user wants to configure the region-specific setting, he needs to provide conditions as part of the policy.

- [ ] It is not possible to provide access based on the region
- [x] Create an IAM policy and define the region in the condition
- [ ] While creating a policy, provide the region as a part of the resources
- [ ] Create an IAM user in the US West region and give access to EC2



### Question 530: A user has configured an EBS volume with PIOPS. The user is not experiencing the optimal throughput. Which of the following could not be a factor affecting the I/O performance of that EBS volume? Explanation: If the user is not experiencing the expected IOPS or throughput that is provisioned, ensure that the EC2 bandwidth is not the limiting factor, the instance is EBS-optimized (or includes 10 Gigabit network connectivity) and the instance type EBS dedicated bandwidth exceeds the IOPS more than he has provisioned. (shw: A)

- [ ] EBS volume size
- [ ] Instance type is not EBS optimized
- [ ] EC2 bandwidth
- [x] EBS bandwidth of dedicated instance exceeding the PIOPS



### Question 531: AWS Elastic Load Balancer supports SSL termination. Explanation: You can configure your load balancer in ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) to use an SSL certificate in order to improve your system security. The load balancer uses the certificate to terminate and then decrypt requests before sending them to the back-end instances. Elastic Load Balancing uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to upload your certificate to your load balancer. (shw: C)

- [ ] False
- [x] True. For specific availability zones only
- [ ] True. For all regions
- [ ] True. For specific regions only



### Question 532: A user has launched an RDS instance. The user has created 3 databases on the same server. What can the maximum size be for each database? Explanation: The AWS RDS DB instance is an isolated DB environment provided by AWS in which the user can create more than 1 database. The maximum size of the instance should be between 5 GB and 3 TB. The size of each DB can be anything in this range. (shw: A)

- [ ] The total instance storage size cannot be more than 3 TB
- [ ] The size of each DB cannot be more than 1 TB
- [ ] It is not possible to have more than one DB on a single instance
- [x] The size of each DB cannot be more than 3 TB



### Question 533: A root owner is trying to create an IAM user of the various departments. The owner has created groups for each department but wants to delineate the user based on the sub-division level. E.g. The two users from different sub-departments should be identified separately and have separate permissions. How can the root owner configure this? Explanation: The path functionality within an IAM group and user allows them to delineate by further levels. In this case, the user needs to use the path with each user or group so that the ARN of the user will look similar to: 1) arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/user1; 2) arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/user2

- [ ] Create a hierarchy of the IAM users which are separated based on the department
- [ ] It is not possible to delineate within a group
- [ ] Create a nested group
- [x] Use the paths to separate the users of the same group



### Question 534: What kind of data can go in an Amazon SQS message? Explanation: Amazon SQS messages can contain up to 256KB of text data, including XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are accepted: #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20 to #xD7FF] | [#xE000 to #xFFFD] | [#x10000 to #x10FFFF] (shw: C)

### Question 535: You are creating a bucket policy to allow access to some users. Which of the below-mentioned options is not a valid resource name as a part of the bucket policy? Explanation: The resource section of an S3 bucket policy accepts ARN. The ARN will have the following format: arn:partition:service:region:namespace:relative-id. Here, "aws" is a common partition name. (If the user's resources are in the China (Beijing) Region, "aws-cn" is the partition name.) You do not specify the region or the namespace. For S3 as a part of the relative ID, the user can specify the bucket or the object name. (shw: A)

- [ ] arn:aws:s3:us-west-1::*
- [ ] arn:aws:s3:::cloudacademy*
- [ ] arn:aws:s3:::cloudacademy/user/${aws:username}/
- [x] arn:aws:s3:::*



### Question 536: In relation to Amazon SQS, what is the difference between the message ID and the receipt handle? Explanation: A new receipt handle is returned every time you receive a message. When deleting a message, you provide the last received receipt handle to delete the message.

- [x] The message ID is a unique identifier for the message, whereas a receipt handle is an identifier associated with the act of receiving the message
- [ ] A message ID cannot be deleted
- [ ] There is no difference
- [ ] The message ID is an identifier associated with the act of receiving the message, whereas a receipt handle is a unique identifier for the message

- [ ] Create IAM roles based on the permission and assign users to each role
- [ ] It is not possible to manage more than 100 IAM users with AWS
- [ ] Create IAM users and provide individual permission to each



### Question 539: The user has configured AutoScaling based on the dynamic policy. Which of the following is not the right command to specify a change in capacity as a part of the policy? Explanation: The user can configure the AutoScaling group to automatically scale up and then scale down based on the various specified CloudWatch monitoring conditions. The user needs to provide the adjustment value and the adjustment type. A positive adjustment value increases the current capacity and a negative adjustment value decreases the current capacity. The user can express the change to the current size as an absolute number, an increment, or as a percentage of the current group size. In this option specifying the exact capacity with the adjustment value = -8 will not work as when the type is exact capacity the adjustment value cannot be negative.

- [ ] "adjustment=-1" (type is ChangeInCapacity)
- [x] "adjustment=-8" (type is ExactCapacity)
- [ ] "adjustment=3" (type is ExactCapacity)
- [ ] "adjustment=-50" (type is PercentChangeInCapacity)



### Question 540: Does AWS CloudFormation support Amazon EC2 tagging? Explanation: In AWS CloudFormation, Amazon EC2 resources that support the tagging feature can also be tagged in an AWS template. The tag values can refer to template parameters, other resource names, resource attribute values (e.g. addresses), or values computed by simple functions (e.g., a concatenated list of strings).

- [x] Yes, AWS CloudFormation supports Amazon EC2 tagging
- [ ] No, CloudFormation doesn't support any tagging
- [ ] It depends on the Amazon EC2 tagging that has been defined in the template
- [ ] No, it doesn't support Amazon EC2 tagging



### Question 541: In DynamoDB, if your items are 1.5 KB and you want to do 10 writes per second, then you would need to provision _____ write capacity units. Explanation: In DynamoDB, if your items are larger than 1 KB in size, you will need to round the item size up to the next 1 KB boundary. For example, if your items are 1.5 KB and you want to do 10 writes per second, then you would need to provision 10 (writes per second) × 2 (1.5 KB rounded up to the next whole number) = 20 write capacity units. (shw: B)

### Question 544: A user has created an EBS volume of 10 GB. The user takes the first snapshot of that volume. What will happen when the snapshot is taken? Explanation: When a user creates a snapshot it asynchronously copies the data modified on the EBS volume. It does not copy the whole volume or all the data written to it, but just the modified one. For the first time, it will copy all the data written on the volume and not copy the blank/empty blocks. (shw: C)

- [ ] The I/O on the volume will be frozen while a snapshot is being taken
- [ ] AWS will create a snapshot of the modified content in the same AZ of the region
- [ ] AWS will create a snapshot of only blocks that are written on the volume
- [x] AWS will copy all the blocks from EBS and create a snapshot

### Question 546: A user is trying to create an S3 bucket named Cloudacademy in the Europe region. What will be the public URL of that bucket? Explanation: As per the S3 naming guidelines capital letters are not supported in the EU regions. Compared to other regions, the US Standard Region currently allows more relaxed standards for bucket naming, which can result in a bucket name that is not DNS-compliant. For example, MyAWSBucket is a valid bucket name, even though it contains uppercase letters. If the user tries accessing this bucket by using a virtual-hosted-style request such as http://MyAWSBucket.s3.amazonaws.com/yourobject, the URL resolves to the bucket myawsbucket and not the bucket MyAWSBucket. In response, Amazon S3 will return a bucket not found error. To avoid this AWS recommends creating DNS compliant bucket name. (shw: C)

- [ ] http://Cloudacademy.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
- [ ] http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ Cloudacademy/
- [ ] S3 will throw an error saying naming criteria are not met
- [x] Both http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ Cloudacademy as well as http://Cloudacademy.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/



### Question 547: A user has attached one RDS security group with 5 RDS instances. The user has changed the ingress rule for the security group. What will be the initial status of the ingress rule?

Once the changes are propagated the rule status will change to authorized. (shw: C)

- [ ] Approving
- [ ] It is not possible to assign a single group to multiple DB instances
- [ ] Authorizing
- [x] Implementing

### Question 549: A user has launched an EC2 instance and installed a website with the Apache webserver. The webserver is running but the user is not able to access the website from the internet. What can be the possible reason for this failure? Explanation: In Amazon Web Services, when a user has configured an instance with Apache, the user needs to ensure that the ports in the security group are opened as configured in Apache config. E.g. If Apache is running on port 80, the user should open port 80 in the security group.

- [ ] The instance is not configured with the proper key-pairs.
- [ ] The Apache website cannot be accessed from the internet.
- [ ] The instance is not configured with an elastic IP.
- [x] The security group of the instance is not configured properly.

- [ ] It is not possible to configure requestor pays for AWS S3
- [ ] The user should enable Devpay on the bucket
- [ ] It is not possible to configure requestor pays when S3 static website hosting is enabled
- [x] The user should enable the requestor pays option for the bucket
