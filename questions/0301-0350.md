- [ ] Invoke the Encrypt API passing the plaintext data that must be encrypted, then reference the customer-managed key ARN in the KeyId parameter.
- [ ] Invoke the GenerateRandom API to get a data encryption key, then use the data encryption key to encrypt the data.
- [ ] Invoke the GenerateDataKey API to retrieve the encrypted version of the data encryption key to encrypt the data.
- [x] Invoke the GenerateDataKey API to retrieve the plaintext version of the data encryption key to encrypt the data.

- [ ] Create a dedicated Amazon CloudFront Distribution for each customer.
- [ ] Use Amazon CloudFront with AWS Lambda@Edge.
- [ ] Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to control access to an S3 bucket.



### Question 305: An application writes items to an Amazon DynamoDB table. As the application scales to thousands of instances calls to the DynamoDB API generate occasional ThrottlingException errors. The application is coded in a language incompatible with the AWS SDK. How should the error be handled?

- [x] Add exponential backoff to the application logic.
- [ ] Use Amazon SQS as an API message bus.
- [ ] Pass API calls through Amazon API Gateway.
- [ ] Send the items to DynamoDB through Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.



### Question 306: An e-commerce web application that shares session state on-premises is being migrated to AWS.

- [ ] Amazon SQS.
- [x] Amazon ElastiCache.
- [ ] Amazon RDS read replica.

The company does not want to lose that session data if a server fails or goes offline, and it wants to minimize user downtime. Where should the company move session data to MOST effectively reduce downtime and make users' session data more fault tolerant?

- [x] An Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster.
- [ ] A second Amazon EBS volume.
- [ ] The web server's primary disk.
- [ ] An Amazon EC2 instance dedicated to session data.

When the user attempts to call the API using this key, the user receives a 403 Forbidden error. Existing users are unaffected and can still call the API. What code updates will grant these new users access to the API? (shw: C)

- [ ] The createDeployment method must be called so the API can be redeployed to include the newly created API key.
- [ ] The updateAuthorizer method must be called to update the API's authorizer to include the newly created API key.
- [ ] The importApiKeys method must be called to import all newly created API keys into the current stage of the API.
- [x] The createUsagePlanKey method must be called to associate the newly created API key with the correct usage plan.



### Question 320: A Developer is writing a mobile application that allows users to view images from an S3 bucket. The users must be able to log in with their Amazon login, as well as Facebook® and/or Google® accounts. How can the Developer provide this authentication functionality? (shw: A)

The code works, gathering all of the necessary information. However, when checking the Lambda function logs, duplicate entries with the same request ID are found. What is causing the duplicate entries? (shw: B)

- [ ] The S3 bucket name was specified incorrectly.
- [ ] The Lambda function failed, and the Lambda service retired the invocation with a delay.
- [ ] There was an S3 outage, which caused duplicate entries of the sale log file.
- [x] The application stopped intermittently and then resumed.

The company also wants the ability to issue automated alerts if the number of callbacks exceeds the defined thresholds. What is the MOST cost-effective way to address the need to track and alert on these statistics?

- [ ] Push callback data to an Amazon RDS database that can be queried to show historical data and to alert on exceeded thresholds.
- [ ] Push callback data to AWS X-Ray and use AWS Lambda to query, display, and alert on exceeded thresholds.

- [ ] Read: 6 read capacity units, Write: 70 write capacity units.
- [ ] Read: 6 read capacity units, Write: 10 write capacity units.
- [x] Read: 3 read capacity units, Write: 10 write capacity units.



### Question 337: A Developer is creating an AWS Lambda function to process a stream of data from an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream. When the Lambda function parses the data and encounters a missing field, it exits the function with an error. The function is generating duplicate records from the Kinesis stream. When the Developer looks at the stream output without the Lambda function, there are no duplicate records. What is the reason for the duplicates? (shw: A)

- [ ] The Lambda function did not advance the Kinesis stream pointer to the next record after the error.
- [ ] The Lambda event source used asynchronous invocation, resulting in duplicate records.
